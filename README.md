# PIMA_DIABETES

This is a Repository contanting my findings from a kaggle dataset related to Indian Diabetes.


Contents in the Repository:

* Diabetes.csv: The Dataset which I have used in all the Jupyter Notebooks.

* Prima_Diabetes.ipynb/html/.py: The initial notebook with its HTML and it's .py version.

* Prima_Diabetes_Mean_Replaced_Values.ipynb/html: These files have a similar approach for building the model except, that there are a few columns who's null values have been replaced by their respective column mean.

* Prima_Diabetes_Mode_Replaced_Values.ipynb/html: These files have a similar approach for building the model except, that there are a few columns who's null values have been replaced by their respective column mode. This notebook gives the best accuracy.
